# Absolute Beginner D&D

This is a place to learn the basics of Dungeons and Dragons, or refresh your skills in 5th Edition D&D.  Sometimes going into an existing campaign, even at first level with experienced players can be bewildering!  

> *What's your AC?  Dex check! Attack Modifier? Advantage! Dead? Death Save?  What?*

This outlines a day long program starting at the absolute beginning, looking at the anatomy of the character sheet, the basics of combat and encouraging role play.  Then it ends in a 'one shot', an afternoon-long self contained game, designed to embed the things you learned in the morning.

## What do I need to bring

Rules, Dice, Snacks, Manners.

### Rules

Download the free basic rules for D&D.  The MTW game is entirely based on this cut-down rule set.  Its exactly the same rules as the other D&D books, just with fewer options so its easier to get started.

[Download the Basic Rules](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)

> **OH MY GOD THAT'S STILL HUNDREDS OF PAGES!**

Don't panic!  Nobody know all the rules.  That's why, if you get into a campaign you're expected to get your own, full rule book, **The Player's Handbook**.  And even then you just try to know the rules that apply to your character's options.

If you want to have look before the game, check out the Introduction (5 pages) and the races and classes, and see what kind of character you might like to play.  If you're going to print it out, you only need the first three sections - don't worry about the Dungeon Master section.

### Dice

It's nice to have your own dice. Your local game shop will have some, and you can find some good sets online.  

[Good NZ based dice shop](https://www.gamesandhobbies.co.nz/shop/polyhedral-dice) - Sets for about NZ $10.00.  

If you're like me you start to get unhealthily large numbers of dice, and have to limit yourself to only buying one set at a time.  Which means that other players will have ones you can use.

### Snacks

As a player you're expected to bring something to keep you going, as the host is already running the game for you.  Most people bring something to share, but it's entirely up to you, especially if you have specific dietary needs.

### Manners

Different games have very different etiquette.  Swearing, table talk, losing your temper, type of humour (sexual, scatalogical...) all depend on the people attending,how well they know each other, and the ground rules set communally.

Here are the guidelines for my games:

- no in-game sexual violence (rape, coerced sex, homo/transphobic talk)
- none of that out of the game either!
- Be on time, people want to get on and play
- Roll your dice on the table, and if they go off, its a re-roll
- Let others see what you rolled before you pick them up
- You might have a great idea for how another player can do something _amazing_, but it's their call.
- Do unto others as you would have them do unto you ('natch)
- If something bothers you, talk about it.  It much easier to apologise quickly and kindly than have something stew.  Talk to the Dungeon Master afterwards if you don't want to bring it up at the time.
- Let the host know if you have a disability, and might need help with sound, lighting, bathroom facilities, handling crosstalk.
- Let the Dungeon Master know if there are things you know you don't want in the game, like physical interrogations, consensual sexual activity.  (Do remember that there is a level of inherent violence in D&D, but there are other roleplaying games where this is not the focus!)
